# Discord Docker Bot - Manage Docker Containers
## Description
This Discord bot allows you to manage Docker containers directly from a Discord server using slash commands. It provides functionalities such as starting, stopping, and restarting containers, listing running containers, and showing logs of a specific container.

## Key Features
- **Container Management**: Supports starting, stopping, and restarting Docker containers via simple commands.
- **List Running Containers**: Displays a list of containers currently running.
- **View Logs**: Shows the last 50 log entries of a specified container.
- **Integration with Docker and Discord**: Utilizes the official Docker Python client (`docker-py`) and `discord.py` library for seamless interaction.

## How to Use

### 1. Available Commands:
- `/docker <container_name> <action>`: Manages containers with the actions `start`, `stop`, or `restart`. Example: `/docker my_container start`.
- `/list_containers`: Lists all containers currently in the `running` state.
- `/container_logs <container_name>`: Shows the logs for a specific container.

### 2. Environment Variables:
- `DISCORD_TOKEN`: The token for your Discord bot.

### 3. Configuration with `docker-compose`:
Here’s an example of how to configure the bot using `docker-compose`:

```yaml
services:
  discord-bot:
      container_name: discord_docker_bot
      image: manucarcor/discord_docker_bot:latest
      environment:
         - DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_token
      volumes:
         - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      restart: unless-stopped

```

## How to Set Up Your Discord Bot

### 1. Create a Discord Bot
To use this bot, you need to create a bot in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications):

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Click on **New Application** and give it a name.
3. On the application page, go to the **Bot** section and click **Add Bot**.
4. Copy the **Token** from this page (you’ll use it in your `docker-compose.yml` under `DISCORD_TOKEN`).

### 2. Set Bot Permissions
To ensure the bot has the correct permissions:

1. In the **OAuth2** section, go to **URL Generator**.
2. Under **OAuth2 Scopes**, select `bot` and `applications.commands` (for slash commands).
3. Under **Bot Permissions**, check the necessary permissions for the bot, such as:
   - `Send Messages`
   - `Read Messages/View Channels`
   - `Manage Messages`
4. Copy the generated URL and paste it into your browser to invite the bot to your server.

### 3. Invite the Bot to Your Server
Use the URL generated in the previous step to invite the bot to your server. The bot will now be able to interact with the server where it’s invited, using the correct permissions.

## Example of Use
1. **Run the Bot**: Ensure that your `docker-compose.yml` is configured correctly with the necessary environment variables. Then, run the following command to bring up the container:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Commands in Discord**: From any channel in the server where the bot is active, you can execute commands such as:
   - `/docker <container_name> start`: Start a specific container.
   - `/list`: List all running containers.
   - `/contrainer_logs <container_name>`: Logs of containers.

## Requirements
- **Docker**: The image requires Docker to manage containers on your server.
- **Discord Bot**: You need to register a Discord bot and obtain its token from the Discord Developer Portal.
- **Docker Permissions**: Ensure that the bot's container has access to Docker on the host machine where it is running.
